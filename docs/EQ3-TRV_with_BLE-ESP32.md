This driver alows the control of Eqiva TRV's (i.e. Thermostat Radiator Valve). Compatible models are:

* Eqiva eQ-3 Bluetooth Smart (141771E0/141771E0A)
* Eqiva eQ-3 Bluetooth Smart(UK Version) (142461D0)

Other Eqiva EQ3 models should work as well, but make sure you select a bluetooth model as there are also non-bluetooth models.

### Setup
Before you can use the TRV you will need to enable bluetooth on the TRV:

1. Press the Mode/Menu button for at least 3 seconds.
1. Select the menu item `bLE` with the control wheel and confirm by pressing the
control wheel shortly.
1. The display will show `OFF` to deactivate the function or `On` to activate the
function.
1. Confirm by pressing the control wheel shortly.
 
!!! Note "Note: No need to pair the TRV"

Next you will need to make sure that BLE is enabled in Tasmota:

1. Configuration
1. Configure BLE
1. Enable Bluetooth

To determine the mac adresses of a trv:

1. Go to the BLE menu in Tasmota
1. Enable active scan
1. In to the tasmota console: trv devlist

This will give you the mac adress of each valve.

!!! note

    * Enable 1 valve at a time as this makes it easier to identify
    * You might need to wait a minute or so or repeat the "trv devlist" command a few times before the devices have been properly identified
    * Keep in mind that the TRV does NOT report the current temperature, only the requested, target, temperature. The Xiaomi Thermometer LYWSD03MMC makes a perfect combo for measuring the room temperature (~USD 4)

### Operating your trv

There are 2 ways to control your TRV:

* The Tasmota Console (convenient for setup)<br>
    syntax: `trv <MAC Address> <command> [options]`<br>
    example: `trv 001A2216A458 settemp 21.5`
* MQTT:<br>
    syntax: `cmnd/<tasmota_topic>/EQ3/<MAC Address>/command [options]`<BR>
    example: `cmnd/ble_esp32/EQ3/001A2216A458/settemp 22.5`

As you can see from the example the MQTT topic is made of:

* Standard Tasmota `%prefix%` : `cmnd`, `stat`
* `%topic%` of the BLE_ESP32 gateway device, here `ble_esp32`
* An `EQ3` element to specifiy this command is specifc to the EQ3 driver
* The MAC address of the EQ3
* The command to the EQ3 or result from the EQ3

After submitting a command you will see one or more of the possible results.<BR>

Status|Description
:---|:---
queued|Command has been accepted by the BLE driver
DONENOTIFIED|Command has been successfully processed by the trv and the results are send in a json format
ignoredbusy|Currently we can only accept a single command in the queue, during the processing of a trv command subsequent commands will be rejected. Please resubmit.
FAILCONNECT|After 3 automatic retries we were not able to contact the trv and we give up. Please resubmit

Under normal circumstance you will get a response from the valve (blestate DONENOTIFIED).

Field|Description
:---|:---
trv|mac address (should be the same as in the topic)
blestate|ble driver status queued/DONENOTIFIED/ignoredbusy/FAILCONNECT
raw|raw data as received from the device
temp|target temperature
posn|valve position (0=closed / 100=fully opened)
mode|manual / auto (auto follows the week program, manual keeps the current requested temperature)
boost|boost mode (valve opened 80 % for 5 minutes) active/inactive
dst|Daylight savings time active active
window|status of the window open functionality (activated when the temperature suddenly drops)
state|child lock enabled (disables the buttons on the TRV)
battery|battery status of the TRV
holidayend|end of holiday mode
